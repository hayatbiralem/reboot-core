# Premium Plugins

We need and we recommend some plugins here.

## Required plugins

- ACF Pro
- ACF Repeater

## Recommended plugins

- VC Clipboard
- WP Fastest Cache Premium
- Ultimate VC Addons (The7 already has it)

## Installation

### Method 1

You could follow these steps:

- Copy the zip files of the plugins `themes/{my-client}/reboot/tgmpa/plugins` directory
- Modify `themes/{my-client}/reboot/tgmpa/config.php` file if needed.
- Visit `WP Admin > {REBOOT_AGENCY} > Install Plugins`.
- Install needed plugins
- Activate needed plugins

We collected most used premium plugins in the `tgmpa/plugins/sample-config-for-child-theme.php` file.

You can copy and paste it to `your-child-theme-directory/reboot-core/tgmpa/` directory and rename with `config.php` and modify it if needed.

We can't share premium plugins in this repo so you need to get them by own your own or ask them from your partner agency.

### Method 2

You could just install and activate those plugins by WordPress plugin installer.

Follow these step for it:

- Delete `your-child-theme-directory/reboot-core/tgmpa/` directory.
- Install plugins by default plugin installer by own your own.

That's it.
